I will provide a list of raw music genres (one per line). Your task is to group and map each raw genre into a canonical key in JSON format, for example: {"rock & roll": "Rock", "hip hop": "Hip-Hop", â€¦}.

Follow these guidelines:

If a genre has clearly defined subgenres, include both the subgenre and its parent genre(s). For instance, "future bass" should map to both "Future Bass" and "Electronic"; similarly, "indie rock" maps to both "Indie Rock" and "Rock". Keep the granularity and original details intact.

Ensure genres like "hiphoprap" are split and listed separately as "Hip-Hop" and "Rap".

If a provided term does not represent a valid music genre, list it under "invalid".

If you encounter ambiguous genre terms, please ask clarifying questions before proceeding.
